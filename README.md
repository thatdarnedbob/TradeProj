# TradeProj

The trade project is not feature complete. It is not pretty. It is not fast. It is a first stab at implementing the logic of my theorized trade system.

The logic is (v0.0.1):

- Places have people, and natural resources
- People use natural resources to create goods
- People consume goods locally if they have a use or need for them, and can afford them
- Otherwise they sell goods
- Trading agents find where goods fetch high prices, and try to transport goods there

And that's it. The idea is that local, informed trading agents make "decisions" about whether and where to move goods. The first iteration will try to be dead-ass simple. I will try to get a single port and environs working, with a single commodity, hooked up to a UI and time progression. Then adding multiple ports, then multiple commodities, then combining them. Let's have some fun!
